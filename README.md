This website is supposed to be a recreation of ticketmaster.Where you buy tickest for sports events concerts,plays etc.The index.html contains the home page with different tickets and you even got a sign in page.
Concerts.html is where you can buy tickets for music events.
Arts.html is where you can buy tickets for plays.
sports.html is where you can buy tickets for sporting events and the css was just changing the text color.

Bootstrap changed my programming epxerience because I feel like putting all these components and images just made coding way more easier.

I followed the MVP plan all the way and the website came out good,I made sure I had very good progress every day so it can be up to date.

I am the most proud of the links going through with the images very smoothly.

I probably would add way more cards and rows so there can be more than 3 tickets in each section and the whole appearance look good.
